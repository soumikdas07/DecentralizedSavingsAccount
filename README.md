# Decentralized Savings Account

## Description
This project demonstrates a decentralized savings account where users can deposit funds, earn interest, and withdraw funds using Solidity smart contracts and Ethers.js for interaction.

## Features
- Deposit ETH
- Withdraw ETH
- Check balance

## Setup Instructions
1. **Smart Contract**: 
   - Open Remix and deploy `DecentralizedSavingsAccount.sol` in the **JavaScript VM** environment. Note the contract address shown under **Deployed Contracts**.
2. **Front-End**:
   - Open `interact.js` and replace `YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` with the actual contract address obtained after deployment.
   - Open `index.html` in a web browser to access the frontend interface.
3. **Simulated Environment**: 
   - Since this is a simulated environment, no external wallet like MetaMask is needed, and you can use the pre-funded accounts provided by the JavaScript VM for testing.
